# ionoscloud-container-registry
Container Registry service enables IONOS clients to manage docker and OCI compliant registries for use by their managed Kubernetes clusters. Use a Container Registry to ensure you have a privately accessed registry to efficiently support image pulls.

⚠️ **Note:**: Container Registry is currently in the Early Access (EA) phase. We recommend keeping usage and testing to non-production critical applications. Please contact your sales representative or support for more information.
